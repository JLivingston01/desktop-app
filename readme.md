## Desktop application

This is a desktop application that runs the logic of a python script, packaged into an executable. This uses PySimpleGUI and pyinstaller. This was developed on windows, but versions can be generated for MacOS and Linux as well.

```
python -m venv .venv
python .venv/scripts/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed app.py
```

The executable can then be found in the dist/ folder that is generated by pyinstaller.
